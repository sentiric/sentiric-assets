# Sentiric Assets

**Description:** This repository stores static assets and resources (e.g., audio files for announcements, images, icons for UI components, general configuration templates) used across the entire Sentiric platform.

**Core Responsibilities:**
*   Providing a centralized location for shared static content.
*   Facilitating version control and management of media and UI resources.

**Technologies:**
*   Primarily contains data files (audio, image, text).
*   May include simple scripts for asset processing or serving.

**Usage:**
This is **not a running service**; it's a **storage repository** or a source for a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Services (e.g., `sentiric-media-service` for announcements, UI services for images) will access resources from here, typically via a storage service (e.g., S3 bucket) or a CDN.

**Local Development:**
1.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sentiric/sentiric-assets.git`
2.  Navigate into the directory: `cd sentiric-assets`
3.  (No specific runtime execution, mainly data files.)

**Deployment:**
Assets are typically deployed to object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) and served via a CDN. Refer to `sentiric-infrastructure` for asset deployment configurations.
